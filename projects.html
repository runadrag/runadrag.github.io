<h4>SciSmalltalk - Solving Ordinary Differential Equations in Smalltalk</h4>
<p>Duration: <span class="date"> May 2013 – October 2013</span></p>
<p>I was the participant of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). My project was SciSmalltalk - Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) in Smalltalk.</p>

<p>So, my main task was to write the methods for solving ODE.
